# computor_v1

This project is about creating a small command-line tool which helps you solve polynomial equations.

## Usage examples

### invalid input
```
>  python computor.py "42 X^2 + 1"
No or too many '=' found


> python computor.py "42 X^2 + 1 = "
Part of equation can not be left blank


> python computor.py "42 X^2 = 0 + "
42 X^2 = 0 + 
           ^
Unrecognised symbol '+' at index 11


> python computor.py "42 X^2 + a * X = 0" 
42 X^2 + a * X = 0
       ^
Unrecognised symbol '+' at index 7


> python computor.py "42 X^2 + 7 * 8 * X = 0"
42 X^2 + 7 * 8 * X = 0
           ^
Unrecognised symbol '*' at index 11

```

### polynomial equations with degree 0

```
> python computor.py "42 + 1 = 0"
Polynomial degree: 0
Reduced form:  + 0 * X^2 + 0 * X + 43 = 0
This equation has no solutions


> python computor.py "42 + 1 = 43"
Polynomial degree: 0
Reduced form:  + 0 * X^2 + 0 * X + 0 = 0
All real numbers are solutions for this equation

```

### polynomial equations with degree 1 (linear equations)
```
> python computor.py "42X = 21"
Polynomial degree: 1
Reduced form:  + 0 * X^2 + 42 * X - 21 = 0
Solution: 
0.5

```

### polynomial equations with degree 2 (quadratic equations)
```
> python computor.py "X^2 + 2X - 3 = 0"
Polynomial degree: 2
Reduced form:  + 1 * X^2 + 2 * X - 3 = 0
D =  16
Discriminant strictly positive, getting answer as two real numbers:
-3.0
1.0


> python computor.py "X^2 - 6X + 34 = 0"
Polynomial degree: 2
Reduced form:  + 1 * X^2 - 6 * X + 34 = 0
D =  -100
Discriminant strictly negative, getting answer as two complex numbers:
3 - 5 * i
3 + 5 * i

```


### polynomial equations with degree bigger then 3
This feature is quite experimental.
It`s usage suggests that all n roots fo the equation are real numbers.

Lobachevsky method is being used as a method for finding approximate roots.

#### 5X^4 - 10X^3 - X^2 + X = 0
![Plot for equation 1](pictures/4th_degree_equation_example1.png)
```
> python computor.py "5X^4 - 10X^3 - X^2 + X = 0"

Polynomial degree: 4
Reduced form:  + 5 * X^4 - 10 * X^3 - 1 * X^2 + 1 * X + 0 = 0
It looks like equation inputted has degree greater then 2.
Hopefully you know what you are doing ðŸ¤”
